Power outages have left about 1.4 million homes and businesses in the dark, according to the website PowerOutage, 
which tracks utility reports. The Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest public utility, ended its rolling 
blackouts Friday afternoon but continued to urge homes and businesses to conserve power. In Georgia, 
hundreds of people in Atlanta and northern parts of the state were without power and facing the possibility of 
sub-zero wind chills without heat. And nearly 5,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. were canceled Friday,  
according to the tracking site FlightAware, causing more mayhem as travelers try to make it home for the holidays.
"We've just got to stay positive," said Wendell Davis, who plays basketball with a team in France and was waiting 
at O'Hare in Chicago on Friday after a series of flight cancellations.
