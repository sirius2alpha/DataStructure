a from phone friends *

On a chilly Saturday afternoon in San Francisco, I was under a patio heater with a group of friends when someone 
said we should get a group photo. What happened next was surprising. Instead of using his phone to take a 
commemorative photo, my friend pulled out a point-and-shoot camera. I thought to myself, "Wait. The phone 
killed the point-and-shoot camera years ago. Why didn't he just use his iPhone?" Granted it was the high-end Sony 
RX100 VII, which is an excellent compact camera and one of the few point-and-shoots still made today.

Phones from Apple, Samsung and Google include some of the best phone cameras you can buy, like the iPhone 14 Pro,
 Google Pixel 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. But for professional photographers and filmmakers, that's not always 
enough. The holy grail is being able to have a truly large image sensor like the one you'd find in a high-end mirrorless 
camera and a lens mount that could attach to your phone. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong.

Everyone from Samsung to Panasonic, Sony and Motorola has tried to make this dream a reality in some way. Now Xiaomi, 
the world's third largest phone-maker (behind Samsung and Apple) is the latest to rekindle the quest for the phone camera 
holy grail. The company has a new prototype phone that lets you mount a Leica M lens on it. 

But this is just a concept. If you're wondering whether phones will ever make dedicated pro cameras obsolete the way they 
did with point-and-shoots, the answer is a resounding no. The past decade has shown us why.
